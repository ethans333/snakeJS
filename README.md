# Snake JS üêç
## A simple snake creation in JavaScript

Before explaining how this project works I would like to note that this was made w/ p5.js.

###### To make the canvas repeatedly draw the frames I would need two functions, a _setup_ function
###### and a _draw_ function.
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
